    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search cross-validation (GridSearchCV) is a technique used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Its purpose is to systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameters and select the combination that yields the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV works by creating a grid of hyperparameter values specified by the user. For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, the algorithm trains the model using cross-validation on the training data and evaluates its performance using a scoring metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). After evaluating all combinations, GridSearchCV selects the combination that maximizes the model's performance based on the chosen metric.\n",

    "Q2. Describe the difference between grid search cv and randomize search cv, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV and random search CV are both techniques used for hyperparameter tuning, but they differ in how they search through the hyperparameter space:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: In grid search CV, the algorithm exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified in a grid. It evaluates each combination using cross-validation and selects the one with the best performance. Grid search is suitable when the hyperparameter space is relatively small, and you want to explore all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: In randomized search CV, the algorithm randomly samples hyperparameter values from predefined distributions. It evaluates a fixed number of random combinations of hyperparameters using cross-validation and selects the one with the best performance. Randomized search is suitable when the hyperparameter space is large or when searching exhaustively is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose grid search CV when you want to explore all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a reasonable search space. On the other hand, you might choose randomized search CV when the search space is large and it is not feasible to explore all combinations exhaustively.\n",

    "Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage refers to the situation where information from outside the training dataset is used to create a model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates or incorrect inferences. Data leakage can result in models that perform well on training and validation data but fail to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are building a credit risk model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on their financial history. If you inadvertently include future information such as the customer's repayment status after the loan approval decision in the training data, the model may learn to exploit this information and make overly optimistic predictions. This is an example of data leakage, as the model is using information that would not be available at the time of making predictions in practice.\n",
